          Creating better communities
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">Zee, a graduate of the University of Waterloo, has a long history of serving in various boards and commities even before entering politics. It is his ability to build communities that got him interested in politics and helped him get elected in 2010 and 2014 as a Town Councillor and 2018 as a Regional Councillor.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">He is an active volunteer and gives his time to matters he feels passionately about, including <strong class="has-text-white">mental health</strong>, sustainability and livable communities. He has served as a director in <strong class="has-text-white">Big Brothers Big Sisters of Halton and Hamilton</strong>, <strong class="has-text-white">Milton Public Library</strong> and <strong class="has-text-white">Milton Transit Advisory Committee</strong>. He has also served as the President of Milton Toastmasters and the co-chair of Milton Economic Development. In the past 8 years, he has chaired more Milton Budget Committees than any other councillor.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">He currently serves in the boards of <strong class="has-text-white">Halton Healthcare</strong>, <strong class="has-text-white">Halton Housing Corporation</strong> and <strong class="has-text-white">Conservation Halton</strong>. He is also a member of the Halton Health & Social Committee.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Through his involvement, he has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for various causes. More recently, he has turned his attention to mental health and has been working with different agencies and charities to tackle this challenge.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Outside of his council duties, he is a successful Engineering leader in a rapidly growing public multinational company. Due to his role in technical companies such as Microsoft, Amazon and Doordash, he understands the value of bold leadership, calculated risk-taking and using data to solve problems.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">He lives in Milton with his wife, their six children and a cat named Sushi.</p>

          The right person for Milton
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">Zee's openness and approach to problem solving is praised even by his critics. He's not afraid to challenge the status quo and considers all points of views from a diverse perspective before arriving at a conclusion. Unlike other politicians, he openly shares his views, even on controversial issues, out of his belief that people must know where their political leaders stand on all issues.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">His curiosity and the ability to go really deep in breaking down complex problems has helped him build a huge following online and offline. Often he is able to find simple solutions by involving consultations into the thinking process. </p>
        <p class="mb-4">Zee believes in the power of partnerships, consultation and bold leadership. The more we understand difficult problems from all angles, the better we are able to uncover solutions that work for everyone.</p>
